# Stat-184

This Github Repository contains the code used for the Statistics 184 Final Project, as outlined in the project requirements.

Note 1: GitHub was unable to take the DT.csv file, as it was too large. It can manually be created by running the code.
Note 2: This code uses plot() on lm models. Do not run all the code at once, as the plot(lm) will prevent several lines after it from running.
